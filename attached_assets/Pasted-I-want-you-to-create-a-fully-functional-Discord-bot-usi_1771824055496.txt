I want you to create a fully functional Discord bot using Discord.js v14 (Node.js) with slash commands and proper permissions handling. The bot should include the following features:

1. Fun Command – Gay-O-Meter

Slash command: /gay @user

When used, it returns a random percentage (0–100%) showing “how gay” the mentioned user is.

The response should be in an embed format.

This is purely for fun and random each time.

2. User Stats Command

Slash command: /stats @user

After using it, it should show:

Total number of messages sent in the server

Total time spent in voice channels

Join date

Possibly roles count

Display all stats in an embed.

The bot must track messages and voice activity automatically.

3. DM Command

Slash command: /dm

When used, it should ask:

Do you want to send to a Role or a User?

If Role is selected:

It sends the same message to every member with that role.

If User is selected:

It sends the message only to that specific user.

Only users with a specific permission (like Administrator or Manage Messages) can use this.

4. Auto Moderation

The bot should automatically detect and delete any message containing:

Discord server invite links (discord.gg / discord.com/invite).

Optionally send a warning message.

Should ignore users with Administrator permission.

5. Reaction Role System

Slash command: /reactionrole

The admin selects:

A message

A reaction emoji

A role

The bot:

Reacts to the message automatically with the selected emoji.

When a user reacts, they receive the role.

When they remove the reaction, the role is removed.

6. Verification System (Advanced)
A. Setup Commands

/verifytab

Sends an embed with:

Custom image

Custom message

A button labeled: Get Verified

/verifyforms <channel>

Sets the channel where verification forms will be sent.

/verifyrole <role>

Sets the role given upon acceptance.

B. Verification Flow

User clicks Get Verified button.

A modal (form) opens with these fields:

IGN:

Who Invited You?

Why You Wanna Join?

Languages:

When submitted:

The results are sent to the configured verification channel.

The message includes two buttons:

Accept

Deny

C. Accept Button

When pressed:

The user receives the configured verification role.

The bot sends a DM saying:
"You have been verified successfully!"

D. Deny Button

When pressed:

A modal opens asking:

Reason?

After submission:

The bot DMs the user:
"Your verification request was denied. Reason: <reason>"

Additional Requirements:

Use proper embeds for clean UI.

Use buttons, modals, and select menus where needed.

Store configuration data in a JSON file or database.

Include error handling.

Use slash commands only.

Organized file structure (commands/events/handlers).
