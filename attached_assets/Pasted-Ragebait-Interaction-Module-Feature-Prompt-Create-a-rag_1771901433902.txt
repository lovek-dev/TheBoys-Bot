Ragebait Interaction Module — Feature Prompt

Create a ragebait interaction system triggered when a user pings the bot.

The goal is to provoke playful frustration while keeping responses configurable and rate-limited.

🎯 Trigger 1: User Pings the Bot

When a user mentions (@bot):

➡ Bot replies with ONE random message from:

“huh? what do you want?”

“what do you want”

“hey.”

“don’t spam ping me.”

“you rang?”

(Optional toggle: NSFW mode for harsher replies)

🎯 Trigger 2: User Replies After Ping

If the same user replies within 15 seconds:

➡ Bot replies with ONE random line:

“Now you can suck my robotic one.”

“sybau.”

“Do you like it?”

“that all you had to say?”

➡ Then apply:

✅ Timeout / mute user for 60 seconds

🎯 Trigger 3: If User Uses Abusive Words

If reply contains:

tmkc, bc, randi, bitch, kutta, chaka, chake, fuck you, fuck off

➡ Bot responds with a savage comeback (no timeout escalation).

Savage Reply Pool

Use random selection:

“Do you have a name for your father yet?”

“You type fast for someone thinking slow.”

“Big anger, tiny vocabulary.”

“You sound like lag in human form.”

“Keep talking, maybe you’ll discover a personality.”

“You’re not roasting me, you’re reheating leftovers.”

“Even autocorrect gave up on you.”

“Try harder, that insult came on dial-up.”

“You argue like patch notes nobody asked for.”

“Congratulations, you played yourself.”

(Keep these sharp but avoid hate speech or explicit sexual content.)

🎯 Trigger 4: Multiple Ping Spam

If a user pings the bot 3+ times within 30 seconds:

➡ Bot replies:

“you really need my attention that badly?”

“relax, I’m not your emergency contact.”

“spam harder, maybe it’ll work.”

“you really like hardcore mode, huh?”

🎯 Trigger 5: Escalation Conversation Trap

After 3+ back-and-forth replies, bot asks:

➡ “do you wanna get out of the server?”

If user replies with:

yes, try it, go on, bet, bitch

➡ Bot removes the Verified role:
that role is the role set in /verifyrole <role>
remove that role from the user

(Use your existing command logic.)

⚙️ Safety & Control Logic (IMPORTANT)

To prevent abuse & bans:

✅ Add cooldown per user (e.g., 2 minutes after timeout).
✅ Add toggle for ragebait module.
✅ Add NSFW mode toggle for harsher responses.
✅ Ignore moderators/admin roles.
✅ Log all timeouts & role removals.

3. Smart Detection
