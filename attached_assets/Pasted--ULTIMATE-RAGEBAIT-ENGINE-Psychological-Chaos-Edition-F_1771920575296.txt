🟢 LEVEL 1 — LIGHT PSYCHOLOGICAL ROAST (1–8)

Tone: subtle ego disruption & calm superiority
Goal: hook & unsettle

Roast Pool (30)

you sound more confident than correct

interesting how sure you are

that felt convincing… not accurate

you’re arguing with certainty, not evidence

that sounded better in your head

your point almost formed

you typed before thinking, didn’t you

logic paused midway

bold claim, fragile support

you seem committed to being wrong

that response felt rushed

accuracy left the chat early

you pressed send with hope

bhai dimag buffering mein hai kya

tu bol raha hai ya guess kar raha hai

itna confidence ka source kya hai

lagta hai bina soche bol diya

tu khud ko convince kar raha hai kya

you’re reacting, not responding

calm thinking took a break

almost a point — almost

coherence not found

you’re filling silence, not making sense

that response felt defensive

thinking clearly might help here

you sound unsure behind the confidence

that message tried hard

reasoning took a shortcut

the idea slipped on exit

accuracy loading…

🟡 LEVEL 2 — EGO DISRUPTION PHASE (9–20)

Tone: embarrassment + behavioral analysis
Add meltdown meter & ratings

Roast Pool (30)

this feels emotional, not logical

you’re arguing harder than you’re thinking

confidence is doing all the work

the louder it gets, the weaker it sounds

you’re repeating, not improving

defensiveness detected

your logic clocked out early

this is turning into a meltdown speedrun

emotional overheating detected

this argument lost structure

you sound more triggered than correct

you keep replying, nothing improves

pressure exposed weak reasoning

🔴 LEVEL 3 — PSYCHOLOGICAL CHAOS PHASE (21–30)

Tone: obsession exposure & dominance psychology

you’re replying out of impulse

this is about ego now

you keep replying hoping it improves

you’re trapped in proving mode

you need the last word

silence would bother you more

☢️ RARE NUCLEAR PSYCHOLOGICAL DROPS

you stopped trying to be right and started trying to win

this isn’t about the topic anymore

the discomfort seems to be the real trigger

you want the last word more than resolution

the conversation moved on — you didn’t

you’re reacting to feeling challenged
